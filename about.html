                        My name is Jonathan Menschaert. <br>
                        I am an aspiring game developer interested in the AI and other techniques used in games to create an adaptive experience. <br>
                        My interests also go beyond the AI behaviors of npcs, I am fascinated by anything that is able adjust dynamically to the situation, 
                        and will gladly learn more about it and more! <br><br>
                        
                        Additionally, I also really like to build tools that can assist me in creating the games I want to make.<br>
                        It can sometimes be very time-consuming to create things entirely by hand, especially in situations where there are specific needs for a project.<br>
                        In such situations it is great to have specialized tools at hand that can automate a part of the process or at least make it easier.<br><br>

                        Because I often experiment with the things mentioned above, I come into contact with a wide range of software and techniques, <br>
                        which I sometimes add to my workflow for a project, so I consider myself a quick learner.<br>
                        I also don't give up easily. I will always try to figure out a solution to a potential problem, and I am not afraid to explore different approaches if the situation asks for it.<br><br>
